- In this repository we value unit tests, jsdoc comments and pure functions without side effects
- Most important design patterns:
  - functional programming
  - immutability
  - composition
  - modularity
  - single responsibility principle
  - dependency injection
- Less is more.
- Whenever you refactor or change something, make sure to remove any dead code, comments or tests. Don't leave technical debt behind.
